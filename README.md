Broadcast is fork of Lenster, A web3 social media platform on the Lens protocol. Visually, things are basically the same at the moment, changes are on the roadmap. 

Broadcast as a effort to help curators monetize their collections. 

## About Broadcast

Broadcast is a decentralized, platform allowing creators to own and curator their content built with Lens Protocol

## known issues and planned updates

1: Can comment, but can't create post:
- It appears Lenster uses Areweave to store posts, for reasons I haven't gotten the bottom creating an post results in a 'something went wrong' error.

As a work around, I've used Pinata as a storage solution, so users can comment on posts, but can't create post. There's a trade off their because Pinata has a lower maximum upload size thresold, but as long as users are ony posting text for the time being, that won't be a problem. 

2: How will this be different from Lens
- To be fair, there only so many way to do socail media, but Broadcast will mainly be focusing mainly enhancing 
curator/artist monetization opportunity, to including creator paid curator streams that users can subcribe to. 

3: Wen updates?
As is often said in Web3 this is still early and this will forming along side the Lens ecosystem. I'll like be posting weekly Dev updates location TBD.
