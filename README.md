Broadcast is a fork of Lenster, A sleek and gorgeous web3 social media platform on the Lens protocol. Visually, things are basically the same at the moment, changes are on the roadmap. 

## About Broadcast

Broadcast is a decentralized, platform allowing creators to own and curator their content built with Lens Protocol

## known issues and planned updates

** I can comment, but can't create posts:**
- It appears Lenster uses Arweave to store posts, for reasons I haven't gotten the bottom of, creating a post results in a 'something went wrong' error.

As a work around, I've used Pinata as a storage solution. At present, users can comment on posts, but can't create post. There's a trade off their because Pinata has a lower maximum upload size thresold, but as long as users are only posting text for the time being, that won't be a problem. 


**How will this be different from Lenster or other platforms?**

- To be fair, there only so many way to do social media, but Broadcast will mainly be focusing on enhancing 
curator/artist monetization opportunities, to include creating paid curator streams that users can subcribe to. 

**Wen updates?**

As is often said in Web3, this is still early, and this project will forming along side the Lens ecosystem. I'll likely be posting weekly Dev updates location TBD.
